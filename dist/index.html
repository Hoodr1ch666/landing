                     overcome the

                  which promises incredible results. Why? It's simple: ISO -certified 3rd party lab test, positive

                  is our duty to determine the actual effectiveness of EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER, <span>to find out if

                     years old and at the beginning of the
                     study, my weight was 194 lbs. I'm married and raising two children. I really want to lose weight
                     and hope for your help.</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Melissa Bargeman:</span> Why do you want to lose weight? Have you
                     experienced any negative consequences
                     of obesity?</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Ronda:</span> I want to lose weight because I have started having
                     health problems and more. I get short
                     of breath even when I go to the store, my heart hurts a little, and my joints hurt. On top of all
                     of this, I have complexes. I don't feel desired, my husband hardly pays any attention to me, and we
                     have sex once every two weeks. I've started noticing how my husband looks at slim girls, and it
                     worries me and makes me jealous. I'm afraid that he will leave our family for someone else. And
                     it's very difficult to find beautiful clothes; it's as if this world is created only for slim
                     people.</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Melissa Bargeman:</span> I understand your concerns and sympathize
                     with you. Obesity is really harmful
                     both for your physical health and psychological well-being. Please tell me, when did you start
                     gaining excess weight?</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Ronda:</span> The weight gain began in a usual way, probably like
                     most girls in my position - pregnancy.
                     I am a mother of 2 children. Before my first pregnancy, my weight was 112 lbs and I felt very good!
                     After the first pregnancy, my weight was already 152 lbs, and after the second 167 lbs. At that
                     time, I wasn't upset about it, I was sure that I would lose weight a little later. I'll start
                     eating less, join a gym. But everything turned out completely the opposite. I started trying diets
                     and after them I did lose weight, but then gained weight back and even more! I never made it to the
                     gym, raising children and work left me no energy. As a result, I gained weight from 167 lbs to 194
                     lbs. It's terrible, as is my health and appearance. That's my whole story, most people are like
                     this.</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Melissa Bargeman:</span> Don't give up, I'm sure you can handle
                     this! When you received your package
                     with EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER, you immediately said it wouldn't work, why do you think so?</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Ronda:</span> The thing is, I tried EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER
                     two months ago, and it didn't help me!
                     I'm convinced it won't help now either, although there's still hope. I'm comforting myself by
                     thinking that these bottles are slightly different, not like the ones I previously ordered.</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"> <span>— Melissa Bargeman:</span> Very interesting observation. When we
                     contacted the official manufacturer of
                     EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER and asked them why there are also negative reviews of their product,
                     they told us that many counterfeits are sold online due to the popularity of the product. We don't
                     like to take their word for it, which is why we started this clinical study to test the
                     effectiveness of the product. Ronda, we wish you and all of us success in this study, thank you for
                     volunteering to help! We will interview you again in a month after using EcoWise ADVANCED FAT
                     BURNER. We have sent you the instructions, all you have to do is follow them.</p>
                  <p class="advanced__texts"><span>— Ronda:</span> I hope I bought a fake then and your package of
                     EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER will help me.
                     Whatever the result may be, thank you for your work, you are doing a great job and trying to convey
                     the truth to the world. Until the next interview!</p>
                  <p class="advanced__subtext">Next, you will find out: what were our concerns and did they come true?

                     are
                     incredible results!</span> In the remaining cases, weight loss was less than 39 lbs, with an
                  average weight
                  loss of 40.7 lbs. In any case,<span>these are extremely serious results</span> that we must share with

               <p class="results__47"> <span>— 47%</span> of the participants experienced regular bowel movements twice
                  a day, similar to individuals with
                  a fast metabolism, and their appetite decreased</p>
               <p class="results__all"> <span>— All participants</span> with problematic skin (acne, oily or dry skin)
                  had these symptoms disappear. This
                  is a sign of detoxification, as the body began to cleanse itself</p>
               <p class="results__last-text"> <span>In conclusion:</span> EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER does indeed work
                  as claimed by the official manufacturer.
                  Judging by the fact that some participants started to see weight loss only from the 12th day of
                  intake, some negative reviews could be based on this, as people simply didn't complete the full
                  one-month course or encountered counterfeit products. There is a detoxification effect on the body,
                  and skin problems disappear. It definitely accelerates metabolism and reduces appetite, among other
                  benefits!</p>

                  study on the EcoWise
                  ADVANCED FAT BURNER dietary supplement, and we were pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness. Please
                  share with me and our readers what you experienced during the course of taking this product. We
                  already know that you were able to lose weight with its help, so how amazed are you by the results?
               </p>
               <p class="second__ronda"><span>— Ronda:</span> Good day. First of all, I would like to thank you once
                  again for such a gift and
                  opportunity. It's simply miraculous! And let me boast right away - my weight is now 147 lbs, I've lost
                  46 lbs in these 30 days. It's a record for me compared to all my previous attempts at dieting! Here's
                  how it all went: I enrolled in the group of participants, received instructions and a package of
                  EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER from you. Every day, I took EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER as instructed and
                  filled out your daily surveys for reporting. In the first few days of taking the supplement, I didn't
                  feel any difference. I thought I was right after my initial disappointment upon seeing the bottles of
                  EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER, as my previous attempt with this supplement didn't help me. But on the
                  9th day of taking it, I felt light and full of energy! I stepped on the scale and saw -11 lbs. I was
                  overjoyed because the supplement started working. It motivated me greatly to continue taking it
                  according to the instructions. And after the 30-day study, I achieved these incredible results! As you
                  mentioned in the instructions, I maintained my usual lifestyle and ate the same way as before the
                  study. It's fantastic! I didn't notice any side effects. The fat just started melting away, that's
                  all!</p>
               <p class="second__melissa"><span>— Melissa Bargeman:</span> Great, thank you for participating in our
                  clinical trial. It is very
                  important for us and for everyone who can't cope with obesity! Please tell us about your future plans
                  and how you feel psychologically, what has changed?</p>
               <p class="second__ronda"><span>— Ronda:</span> My plans are to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 112
                  lbs. I'm confident
                  that with another month of taking EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER, I'll easily achieve my goal!
                  Psychologically, I've changed a lot. Since I started believing in my dream of having a fit body again,
                  I smile more often, feel more confident, my insecurities are slowly disappearing, and I've become more
                  calm and peaceful. My husband is also very surprised, and our relationship has improved. After a
                  30-day trial, he gave me flowers and lifted me up, it feels great to feel like a young girl again, as
                  if I'm 20 years old again! Thanks again to you and your lab for providing me with these opportunities!

                           me and my colleagues. The official manufacturer doesn't disclose the secret of why it works,
                           so their product cannot be completely copied. We understand them, otherwise we would have
                           told you how EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER works in the article, but we cannot do that. Just
                           try it, there was no one who couldn't lose weight in our study. Good luck!</p>
